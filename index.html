                <p>AS I sat alone, by blue Ontario’s shore, 
                    As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace returned, and the dead that return no
                     more, 
                    A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me; 
                    Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America—chant me
                     the
                     carol of victory; 
                    And strike up the marches of Libertad—marches more powerful yet;
                    And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy.
                     
                    
                    (Democracy—the destined conqueror—yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere, 
                    And Death and infidelity at every step.</p>

                    <div id="standard 2">
                    <p>A Nation announcing itself, 
                        I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,
                        I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.
                         
                        
                        A breed whose proof is in time and deeds; 
                        What we are, we are—nativity is answer enough to objections; 
                        We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded, 
                        We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,
                        We are executive in ourselves—We are sufficient in the variety of ourselves, 
                        We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves; 
                        We stand self-poised in the middle, branching thence over the world; 
                        From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.
                         
                        
                        Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,
                        Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only.
                         
                        
                        (O mother! O sisters dear! 
                        If we are lost, no victor else has destroyed us; 
                        It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.</p>

                        <p>Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme?
                            There can be any number of Supremes—One does not countervail another, any more than
                             one
                             eyesight countervails another, or one life countervails another.
                             
                            
                            All is eligible to all, 
                            All is for individuals—All is for you, 
                            No condition is prohibited—not God’s, or any.
                             
                            
                            All comes by the body—only health puts you rapport with the universe.
                            
                            
                            Produce great persons, the rest follows.</p>
